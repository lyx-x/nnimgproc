# Learn image processing with neural network

This project aims at giving a common platform for learning image processing task with neural network.
The structure of the project is very simple:

1. Specify an image processing pipeline using traditional Python code
2. Declare a neural network model
3. Train the network with pre/post-processing methods so the input/output dimension matches
4. Save and test the model
